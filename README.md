## 🎯 Overview

HallowBranch is a family genealogy platform I built to help families preserve their history privately. Unlike commercial genealogy services that require sharing family data with third parties, HallowBranch keeps everything within the family while providing modern collaborative features.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🛡️ Complete Privacy** - Family-only access with no public data sharing
- **👥 Real-time Collaboration** - Live editing with change attribution
- **📸 Rich Media Support** - Photo and document integration with drag-and-drop
- **🌐 Modern Web App** - Responsive design for all devices
- **🔐 Enterprise Security** - Row-level security with family-based access controls
- **⚡ Fast Performance** - Optimized for 20+ concurrent family members

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Supabase account and CLI installed globally
- Git for version control

### Quick Start (3-4 days to MVP)

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url> hallowbranch
cd hallowbranch

# 2. Configure Supabase
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
supabase db reset

# 3. Setup environment
cd nextjs
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase keys

# 4. Install and run
yarn install
yarn dev
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/project-management/IMPLEMENTATION.md](docs/project-management/IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## 🏗️ Architecture & Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Real-time)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library
- **Deployment**: Vercel with environment-based configuration

### Key Architecture Decisions

Our technical decisions are documented in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):

- **[Use Razikus Template as Foundation](docs/project-management/decisions/20250921-use-razikus-template-foundation.md)** - Why we chose the Razikus template
- **[Use Supabase as Backend Platform](docs/project-management/decisions/20250921-use-supabase-backend.md)** - Backend platform selection
- **[Use family-chart for Tree Visualization](docs/project-management/decisions/20250921-use-family-chart-visualization.md)** - Tree visualization component

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Core entities for family genealogy
persons (id, first_name, last_name, birth_date, death_date, biography, ...)
relationships (id, person1_id, person2_id, relationship_type, ...)
person_media (id, person_id, file_url, file_type, caption, ...)
families (id, name, description, created_by, ...)
family_members (id, family_id, user_id, role, joined_at, ...)
```

## 🎯 Development Roadmap

### MVP Phase (Week 1-4)

**Goal**: Validate core hypotheses about privacy needs and collaboration value

- **Week 1**: Foundation setup and family member CRUD
- **Week 2**: Photo upload integration and Google OAuth
- **Week 3**: Real-time collaboration and basic tree view
- **Week 4**: Testing and launch to beta families

**Success Metrics**:

- 50+ families sign up in first month
- 70% of users upload at least one photo
- 60% of families have 3+ active contributors

### Enhanced Phase (Week 5-8)

- Enhanced media management and galleries
- Activity feeds and change history
- Advanced tree visualization modes
- GEDCOM import/export capabilities

### Advanced Phase (Week 9-12)

- Timeline and geographic visualization
- Statistics dashboard
- Print-friendly and PDF generation
- Advanced search and filtering

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

HallowBranch prioritizes family privacy from the ground up:

- **Family-Only Access**: Only invited family members can view and edit the family tree
- **Complete Data Control**: All family data stays within the family - no third-party access
- **Secure Architecture**: Built with modern security practices and data protection
- **Transparent Development**: Technical decisions documented for accountability
- **Personal Ownership**: Families maintain complete control over their genealogy data

## 💰 About Hosting Costs

HallowBranch runs on modern cloud infrastructure with very reasonable costs:

- **Supabase**: $25/month for typical family usage (database, auth, storage)
- **Vercel**: $0-20/month (hosting and deployment)
- **Total**: Around $25-50/month for a family genealogy project

This is significantly more cost-effective than commercial genealogy services while giving families complete control over their data.

## 🔧 Development Setup

The project uses [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for development environment management. To get started:

1. **Install Mise** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   curl https://mise.jdx.dev/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Setup local environment**:

   ```bash
   cp .mise.local.toml.example .mise.local.toml
   # Edit .mise.local.toml with your local Supabase credentials
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and start development**:
   ```bash
   mise run setup
   mise run dev
   ```

### **Available Commands:**

```bash
mise run dev        # Start development server
mise run build      # Build for production
mise run lint       # Run code linting
mise run supabase   # Start local Supabase
mise run types      # Generate TypeScript types
mise run clean      # Clean build artifacts
```
